# us-crime

This project demonstrates the use of RCurl and cookies to 
[extract](get_fbi_ucr_data.R) data from a multi-page form query tool on a website.

The data source is the US DOJ FBI [Uniform Crime Reporting](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr) (UCR)
[Datatool](http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/).

The data is used to create an interactive 
[motion-chart](us_violent_crime_by_local_agency_motion_chart.R) showing various crimes types by city (local 
law enforcement agency) over time.
